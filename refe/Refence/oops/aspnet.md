ASP.NET is a free web framework for building websites and web applications on .NET Framework using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
ASP.NET MVC 5 is a web framework based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
Developers can build dynamic web applications using ASP.NET MVC framework that enables a clean separation of concerns, fast development, and TDD friendly.

MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.
Model represents the data
View is the User Interface.
Controller is the request handler.

when a user enters a URL in the browser, it goes to the webserver and routed to a controller. 
A controller executes related view and models for that request and create the response and sends it back to the browser.

The controller handles the user request. 
Typically, the user uses the view and raises an HTTP request, which will be handled by the controller.
The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response.

View in MVC is a user interface. 
View display model data to the user and also enables them to modify them. 
View in ASP.NET MVC is HTML, CSS, and some special syntax (Razor syntax) that makes it easy to communicate with the model and the controller.
