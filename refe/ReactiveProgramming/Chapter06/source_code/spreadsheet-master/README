spreadsheet is a C++ library that enables "spreadsheet-programming", i.e., setting up variables ('cells') where each cell is assigned an expression that can contain the values of other cells. Changes are propagated to all dependent cells, as in a spreadsheet.

You create a new cell as follows:

    Cell<double> a = sheet.NewCell<double>("a");

And you assign an expression to a cell as follows:

    Cell<double> a = sheet.NewCell<double>("a");
    Cell<double> b = sheet.NewCell<double>("b");

    a.Set( SQRT(2 * b()) );
    b.Set(18.3);

You get the current value of a cell with:

    a.Value()

See main.cpp for a complete program with a simple usage example. 

Spreadsheet was developed to demonstrate the use of streamulus. There are currently a few limitations, which will be removed if there is interest in this library for its own sake:

* Cyclic dependencies are not detected. You will be rewarded with the infinite loop you deserve. 
* Note that in the code above, we needed to write "b()" in the expression assigned to a, rather than just "b". This is unfortunate, and with some proto-trickery can be fixed.

spreadsheet is a header-only library. It uses boost and streamulus. So put these three libraries in your include path. That's all.
