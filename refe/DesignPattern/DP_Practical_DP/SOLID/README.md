In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

## SOLID design principles:

#### Single responsibility principle (SRP):
a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).		
#### Open/closed principle (OCP):
software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification.		
#### Liskov substitution principle (LSP) :
objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.	
#### Interface segregation principle (ISP) :
many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
#### Dependency inversion principle (DIP) :
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
